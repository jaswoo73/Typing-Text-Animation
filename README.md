## Customization

To customize the typing text animation, you can modify the CSS variables in the :root selector of the CSS file (typing-text-animation.css). The following variables are available for customization:
<br>
:root {
<br>    --bg-color: hsl(60 57% 94%);        /* Background color of the animation */
<br>    --typewriterSpeed: 3.5s;            /* Speed of the typewriter effect */
<br>    --typewriterCharacters: 24;         /* Number of characters in the typewriter effect */  <br>
}
Feel free to adjust the values of these variables to achieve the desired visual and timing effects.
